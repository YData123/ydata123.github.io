Introductory Machine Learning
====

S&DS 265 introduces some of the key ideas and techniques in machine learning. Algorithms and concepts are presented to build intuition for how different methods work, without advanced mathematics. Assignments give students hands-on experience with the methods on different types of data. Topics include linear regression and classification, tree-based methods, topic models, language models, word embeddings, two-layer and recurrent neural networks, reinforcement learning, and an introduction to deep learning. Examples come from a variety of sources including political speeches, archives of scientific articles, real estate listings, and natural images. Programming is central to the course, and is based on the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks.

Computing for the course uses Python in Jupyter notebooks. These can be run using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with the [iML environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YData123/sds265-fa21/main/env/iml_env.yml) adopted by the course <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YData123/sds265-fa21/main/env/iml_env.zip" download>(click here to download)</a>
; instructions for installing this environment are available on [Yale Canvas](https://canvas.yale.edu).  The notebooks can also be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the [<img width="25" src="colab.svg">](https://colab.research.google.com) icon.
