YData: An Introduction to Data Science ![noisy Y](./noiseY-150.png)
====

YData aims to enhance students' knowledge and capabilities in the fundamental ideas and skills of data science.
Derived from Berkeley's popular [Data 8](http://data8.org) course, YData is an introduction to data science that emphasizes
computational and programming skills along with inferential thinking.

The course is designed to be accessible to students with little or no
background in computing, programming, or statistics. At the same time, 
it is meant to be engaging for more technically oriented students, through the extensive
use of examples and hands-on data analysis.  


Materials
---

Much of the content for the course is derived from [Data 8](http://data8.org),
which has made assignments, the textbook and other materials available online under a Creative Commons license.
The textbook is [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data
Science](http://inferentialthinking.com), a free online resource that
includes interactive Jupyter notebooks and public data sets for all examples.
It's maintained as an [open source
project](https://github.com/data-8/textbook).


Computing
---

The course is based on the Python programming language and a
special-purpose cloud computing platform for students to edit and
execute their code in Jupyter notebooks. This "levels the playing field" with respect to
prior computing and programming experience, and makes it easy for
students to get started. The computing platform for YData is being
developed by [Ben
Evans](https://research.computing.yale.edu/about/staff/benjamin-evans)
at the [Yale Center for Research Computing
(YCRC)](https://research.computing.yale.edu/).

(For the code cognoscenti, the platform is based on a
[Kubernetes-based deployment of
JupyterHub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and
notebooks use a Python 3 installation with the standard modules from
[an Anaconda installation](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) such as
Numpy and Matplotlib, as well as the Berkeley
[datascience](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datascience/) module.)

Spring 2019

The course will be offered for the first time at Yale in Spring 2019. Further details will be available here during the Fall 2018 semester.
