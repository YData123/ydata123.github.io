Intermediate Machine Learning
===============================

<div class="classMap">

S&DS 365 is a second course in machine learning at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level.
The course assumes familiarity with the basic ideas and techniques in machine learning, for example as
covered in S&DS 265. The course treats methods together with mathematical frameworks that provide intuition and justifications for how and when the methods work. Assignments give students hands-on experience with machine learning techniques, to build the skills needed to adapt  approaches to new problems. Topics include nonparametric regression and classification, kernel methods, risk bounds, nonparametric Bayesian approaches, attention and language models, generative models, sparsity and manifolds, and reinforcement learning. Programming is central to the course, and is based on the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks.

As prerequisites, students are expected to have a background in probability and statistics, at the level of S&DS 242 (Theory of Statistics), familiarity with the core ideas from linear algebra, for example through Math 222 (Linear Algebra with Applications), and computational skills at the level of S&DS 265 (Introductory Machine Learning) or CPSC 200 (Introduction to Information Systems).
