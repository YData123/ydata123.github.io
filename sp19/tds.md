YData: Seminar on Text Data Science 
====

This YData seminar provides an introduction to the analysis of text data.
The focus is on simple but often powerful text processing
techniques that do not require linguistic analyses, to gain
familiarity with working with text data. Sources used in the seminar
include novels, political speeches, scientific journals, online
FAQ and discussion boards, Wikipedia, and consumer
product reviews. Methodologies include scraping, wrangling, hashing,
sorting, regressing, embedding, and probabilistic modeling.  The
course is based on the Python programming language within a cloud
computing platform, and is paced to be accessible to students who have
previously taken or are currently enrolled in YData (S&DS 123).
